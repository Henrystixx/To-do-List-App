# Starting All Over Again

I've been learning JavaScript for over a year now(though I've been inconsistent).  Originally, my plan was to finish learning it before touching any project, because of my previous experience; building projects without grasping the logic behind them. While I completed some, I left some uncompleted.

Listening to a recorded space hosted on X by Crazy Code, eventually changed my mind.  Someone said something(can't remember his name), he said that learning shouldn't stop one from building projects, because after you done learning without building anything, you'd have forgotten most of the things you learnt.

So, I took a bold step to delete my previous repositories(twas nonsense anyway), searched for projects on YouTube relating to everything that I've learnt so far. Learnt how to use git the same night that I started this project. Sir Tosin Olugbenga influenced my decision to learn git btw, and I'm glad I took his advise.

I am making this my first official project, let's see how far I can go. 5 years from now, I'll come back to this, I hope I'd be able to control my laughter lol.
